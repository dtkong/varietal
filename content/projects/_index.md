A number of my personal projects and experiments include the following projects. Read more about my research interests and background [here](@/about/_index.md). 

## 2020
**Chess & The Internet** — is a [chess streaming talkshow crossover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OykSjfKvzOo). I grew up playing chess competitively but stopped upon starting high school. 15 years later, I decided to pick chess up again and realized that I had the most fun with chess as a social activity. Thus, _Chess & The Internet_ was borne as an intersection of my interest in how games and strategy relate to life, investing, technology, and more.

## 2019
**Refactor Camp 2019** — I was a core organizer of Refactor Camp 2019, a conference and get together for the Ribbonfarm community. Videos are up [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJuBuwyTnr7XrMQia2Rw_bw).  I particularly recommend the keynotes by Sarah Perry and Tiago Forte.

**Prototyping Permanent Cultures** — was a talk I gave virtually at [Trust](https://trust.support/), an "incubator for utopian conspiracy" in Berlin. In this presentation, I offered a framework for considering how to apply lean startup theory, permaculture, and other toolkits to existential problems like climate change, cost disease, and more. Much of this talk was a synthesis (and culmination) of my professional and personal research from the past 5 years. 

## 2016—
**biosphere(x)** — is an urban permaculture and engineering collective I've been actively involved in for the past several years. We work on land and community projects promoting resiliency. 

## 2015-
**General Chang's Chicken** - was a gluten-free fried chicken popup operating out of Brooklyn Night Bazaar. 

## 2013—
**EL garden** - is a community garden I helped start in Brooklyn, NY. 

**agtech NYC** - is a meetup focused on agriculture tech. I was also a founding member of the NY Agriculture Collective.
