A number of my personal projects and experiments include the following. Read more about my research interests and background [here](@/about/_index.md). 

## 2020
**Chess & The Internet** — is a [chess streaming talkshow crossover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OykSjfKvzOo) exploring how games and strategy relate to life, sociality, investing, technology, and more.

## 2019
**Refactor Camp 2019** — Refactor Camp is a conference from the Ribbonfarm community. I had the honor of being a core organizer for [2019](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/06/20/reflections-on-refactor-camp-2019/). Videos are up [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJuBuwyTnr7XrMQia2Rw_bw).  I particularly recommend the keynotes by [Sarah Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK-EzsD3-U0) and [Tiago Forte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR_jtqLBuWw).

**Prototyping Permanent Cultures** — was a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUJFhersu1g) I gave at [Trust](https://trust.support/), a Berlin-based "incubator for utopian conspiracy". In this presentation, I offer the sketch of a framework for how to define permanent cultures and how they might address existential problems of our times (climate change, cost disease, etc.).
