I grew up wanting to be a neuroscientist, but, soon after entering college, I found myself disinterested in working in wet labs. Increasingly through my studies, I gravitated towards economics and biology as systems disciplines. Still, as a rising senior, I became disillusioned with academia and its political-bureacratic trappings and began looking for work in industry.

I took an entry-level job in the technology industry, teaching myself to be a product manager and learning how to move an organization from 0->1. In my off time, I was doing the same but exploring my interests in food systems and resiliency.

It was around that time that I also stumbled upon bitcoin. While I didn't have much of a clue, there I discovered the frenetic beauty of financial markets and found parallels in decentralization culture to my interest in communal resilience & agency. Years later, I would find myself professionally working on blockchain infrastructure and financial services. Over the years, I've been able to meld many influences and ideas into an approach to work and life.

These days, my research interests include:
* permaculture and regenerative agriculture
* physical and movement cultures
* supply chains, finance, and risk management
* product and organizational development
* long-term progress and speculative futures

Varietal Digital is a studio that extends my research and practice professionally while also acting as a holding company for [personal projects](@/projects/_index.md).

I hope you will reach out if you might be interested in chatting or [working together](@/services/_index.md). I'm always interested in new projects and ideas.
