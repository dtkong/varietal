## Personal

I grew up wanting to be a neuroscientist, but, soon after entering college, I found myself disinterested in working in wet labs. Increasingly through my studies, I gravitated towards economics and biology as systems disciplines. Still, as a rising senior, I became disillusioned with academia and its political-bureacratic trappings and began looking for work in industry.

I started my career taking an entry-level job in the technology industry, teaching myself to be a product manager and learning how to move an organization from zero to one. In my off-time, I was doing much of the same but exploring my interests in food systems and resiliency.

It was around that time that I also stumbled upon bitcoin. While I didn't have much of a clue, there I discovered the frenetic beauty of financial markets and found parallels in decentralization culture to my interest in communal resilience & agency. Years later, I would find myself professionally working on blockchain infrastructure and financial services. I've been able to meld many influences and ideas over the years into an approach to work and life.
